The [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) developers implemented an amazingly fast spatial convolution as an extension to [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/). However, it was not (yet?) merged back into upstream.

Frugally-deep reuses this functionality by having the needed files as plain copies here.
